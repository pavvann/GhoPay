## Utilizing Unified Payments System (UPI)
Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) that facilitates inter-bank transactions. It is a revolutionary system designed to enable secure, instant, and easy money transfers directly between bank accounts on a mobile platform. UPI allows users to send or receive money using unique identifiers known as UPI IDs or Virtual Payment Addresses (VPAs), without the need to enter bank account details or IFSC codes, making the process simpler and more streamlined.
